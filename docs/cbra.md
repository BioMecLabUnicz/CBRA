# What is CBRA?
<p align="justify">
CBRA, Cardiac Biomarkers Release Analyzer, is an innovative software platform for personalized medicine, created to support the clinical decision. The core of CBRA is represented by the model-based identification algorithm, which make it possible to reconstruct the release curve of some of the most important biomarkers of cardiac damage, in patients with acute myocardial infarction and ST-segment elevation, STEMI.

# How CBRA works?
<p align="justify">
Ordinary Differential Equations describe the variation of plasmatic concentration of cardiac biomarker, such as cTnT, allowing to reconstruct and extract important clinical parameters from a few experimental data.
